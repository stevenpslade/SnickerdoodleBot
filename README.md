Snickerdoodle Bot is built with ruby and the [twitter gem](https://github.com/sferik/twitter).

## How It Works
Searches for mentions of @rainorshineYVR and snickerdoodle or just @rainorshineYVR. It then retweets or favorites depending on what it finds. Snickerdoodle Bot lives on Heroku and is scheduled to run once per day.
